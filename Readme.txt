Recently graduated and currently seeking Software Engineer, Computer Engineering or 
Project Manager Jobs. I have high energy and drive towards projects that I undertake. 
I am an out of the box thinker and tend to have very creative solutions to problems. 
I am extremely attentive to detail and spend the majority of time on developing the 
idea and solution as a whole before implementing construction and code. 
These qualities usually place me as more a creative lead within group dynamics.

Before my core academic courses in computer engineering I have had work experience 
doing engineering consulting. I have experience with defining customer specifications, 
creating proposals, creating bills of materials, designing, manufacturing, testing, and 
delivering products at deadline. I have experience with carrying a product through 
its entire lifecycle, from conception to its delivery to the client.

During my core academic courses at university I was involved in many academic projects.
I was able to combine my past consulting experience with my transistor level to 
application level computer education to create much more complex solutions and products.
An example product was my virtual reality baton capstone project in which we mapped the 
movement of our custom hardware baton with custom hardware sensors placed around the room
and projected these movements onto a GUI.
